# Algorithms
A place to put some of my algorithm implementations. 

Algorithms included:

BFS, DFS, A* algorithms for path finding on graphs.

Minimax algorithm
-For two players vs a bot that always plays optimally.

TODO:
Need to fix A* function so that it is admissible. Since the function is not admissible the path returned is not optimal.
